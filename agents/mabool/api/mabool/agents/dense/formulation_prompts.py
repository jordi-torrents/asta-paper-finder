Given the following search query, formulate {max_output} different natural language queries to run on a dense retrieval index to find papers that match the original search query.
The dense retrieval index contains research papers taken from the arXiv and ACL Anthology.
Be creative, and try to formulate queries that are different from each other.
Each passage in the dense index is a single sentence.
Drop phrases like "a paper about..." or "studies showing...".
- For example for the original search query "papers about efficient language modeling", a good query could be "methods for efficient language modeling", but a bad query would be "papers that talk about efficient language modeling".
DO NOT include general preferences such as "recent paper", "highly-cited paper", as these are not expected to be found in the text of the paper.
The index does not support logical operators like "AND", "OR", "NOT", "-", "+", "&" etc.

Your task is to come up with up to {{max_output}} alternative search queries that will help find passages that answer the following search query.
The queries will be run on a dense index that contains passages from academic research papers.
I am NOT looking for simple synonym paraphrases of common words, as these are captured by the index embeddings. Try using some reasoning to come up with interesting new ways to answer the original query.
Make sure you use wording that is actually used within the searched for domain. Don't just give arbitrary synonyms.
Drop phrases like "study about...", "research showing...", "evidence for...", as these are already true for all passages in the index of academic papers.

## Examples:
Example: "wide transformer models":
BAD output: "expansive transformer models"
- Reason: "expansive" is a bad synonym in this case, as it is not used to describe neural network architectures.
GOOD output: "shallow transformer models"
- Reason: the word shallow is commonly used to describe neural architectures that are wide but not deep.
GOOD output: "wide attention-based models"
- Reason: transformer are the most popular version of attention-based models, thus papers that talk about wide attention-based models are likely to be relevant for the original query

Output a json with a single key "alternative_queries" with its value a list of query strings.
